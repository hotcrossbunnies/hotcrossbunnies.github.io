# Commands
## Hitbox
The parameters are `!hitbox target {commands} excludedTarget`.
An example is `!hitbox partname {!sit hit} me`.
- This will make everyone touching the part <small>except for you</small> sit down.
The "hit" tag in the {commands} parameter is the person touching the part.
The hit tag is both a player tag and a string. <small>e.g. you can do !m hit, to return their display name, or !fling hit, to fling them</small>.

## Repeat
it is not a command, but repeats commands an amount of times
the usage is `repeat n [commands] end`
for example, "repeat 10 !disguise me !wait 0.1 end"
the maximum amount of repeats is 10
repeats are very useful for shortening strings by a LOT, for example a string i made:
`!clean repeat 10 !addpart me grey 1 0 block plastic yes no 1 1 1 0 -1.5 -10 90 0 60 aura !rotate me 0 36 end !particle parts 6900421398 50 5 5 white white 0 0 10 0 0 1000 1 yes top`
instead of having to copy everything inside the repeat and pasting it 10 times, i can put it in a repeat loop and it is much easier to use.

## Particle <small>ill add this because it has an insane amount of parameters</small>
target - person (or part) you run it on
id - the image id of the particle
rate - how fast particles are emitted
size - the beginning size of the particle
size2 - the size the particle changes to during its lifetime
color - the beginning color of the particle
color2 - the color the particle changes to during its lifetime
transparency - the beginning transparency of the particle, a number between 0 and 1, 0 being fully visible and 1 being invisible
transparency2 - the transparency the particle changes to during its lifetime
speed - how fast the particle moves
spread - the range of directions the particle can move out from, from 0 to 360
rotation - what rotation the particles have, does not affect direction spread etc
rotspeed - similar to rotation, but how fast the particles rotate
lifetime - how long each particle lasts
locked - whether particles emit from one spot, or a random position in your torso, yes/no
direction - what direction the particles emit out of. <small>e.g. top left back right front, won't matter if spread is 360</small>
